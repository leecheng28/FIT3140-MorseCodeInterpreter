# FIT3140 Assignment 5 Iteration 1. Team 29.

## Project Description ##
In this project, we implement "version 0.1" of the Morse Code Interpreter app, using Firebase and Johnny-five library. 
This is the first iteration of assignment 5, we have a list of user stories to implement. Among these, we need to develop test
cases for two user stories. They are, 
1) As an app user, I want the server to determine whether the incoming message is long or short.
2) As an app user, I want to decode the motion sensor messages to be decoded into English letters based on Morse code coding 
table.
