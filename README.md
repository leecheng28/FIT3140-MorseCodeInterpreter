# FIT3140 Assignment 5 Iteration 1. Team 29.

## Project Description ##
In this project, we implement "version 0.1" of the Morse Code Interpreter app, using Firebase and Johnny-five library. 
This is the first iteration of assignment 5, we have a list of user stories to implement. Among these, we need to unit test two user stories. They are, 
1) As an app user, I want the server to determine whether the incoming message is long or short.
2) As an app user, I want to decode the motion sensor messages to be decoded into English letters based on Morse code coding table.

Each user story test is made up of simple test cases(normal program behavior), error test cases(program behavior upon accepting wrong inputs), complex test cases(if applicable). Mocha and Chai testing framework are used to implement the testing.

For more information about tests. [test plan](TODO. http link)
